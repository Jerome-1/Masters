Progressive Web App For a Library App.

This library app is my first project that I have completed on my own. The purpose of this report is to design a 
web-application of a local library in the form of a Progressive web application to try an increase accessibility to their 
members. 

Scenario:
Due to the aftershock of the covid pandemic has caused a negative influence on mental health and well-being for people around
the globe, there has been a rise in negative mental health cases. It has been noted that leisure activity,such as reading a 
book, brings down a persons stress and anxiety levels, therefore improving ones mental health. However, it is becoming 
increasingly more difficult to take the time to explore oneâ€™s interests, due to being overwhelmed with the pressures of life.
As such, less time is spent in the library looking for their next book. 

Purpose of the PWA:
The purpose of the Progressive Web Application is to provide more ways for library members to have access to books they have
a potential interest in. The point of this application isn't to replace a physical library for a digital one, as the majority
of book readers enjoy the atmosphere a library provides.Instead, the PWA will allow library members to save some time in the
day by using it as an intermediary for a library.

Project Aims:
1.	Produce a Progressive web app that is simple to use for all library members.
2.	Produce a web app that showcases numerous books from a library for members to see. Users should also have the ability to
reserve the book for checkout.
3.	Give all users the same level of accessibility when it comes to searching for a book, regardless of their internet 
connectivity.
4. Allow users to only be able to preview a selected book, rather than provide full access to content.
5. Allow Members to filter their searches.

Application Features That Support This Project:
- Application can function regardless of internet connectivity. 
- Application is served through a web-browser and is not platform or device specific. 
- For easier use, application can be installed to the device its being viewed on. 

Running this Project: 
Node.js, Express, mysql2 and supervisor are being used to run this project.
Use NPM install to download all the dependicies. 
Npm start is used to start the server the application is being used on.
