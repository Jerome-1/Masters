No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure? On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains.

He ate his cereal, had a shower, brushed his teeth and combed his hair. Shawn opened his wardrobe searching for his favourite blue and white jumper, black trousers and dinosaur socks. He found them folded neatly on the middle shelf. Shawn carefully put on his clothes and smiled at his appearance in the mirror. “It is going to be a good day” said Shawn gleefully. “Ruby!” he called, searching for his cute cat. He had gotten Ruby for a birthday present last year after begging his mum and dad for a pet. All his friends had a pet and Shawn did not like feeling left out.  Ruby was a tabby cat who loved playing with her toy fish. As Shawn walked into the living room, he expected to see Ruby in his cat tower. This is because Ruby was always there in morning. On this day however, she was not there. “Ruby?” asked Shawn. He couldn’t find her anywhere. “Meow!, meow!” Ruby cried. Shawn looked out the window and searched his garden. As he frantically looked for Ruby he saw a fluffy tail swaying from a tree branch nearby. His eyes slowly panned up the tree until he saw a fluffy tabby cat. “RUBY!” Shawn shouted. Shawn saw Ruby up in a tall tree with no way down…')

The winding was blowing calmy through the trees, and gently kissing her fur. As she travelled through the forest, she began to see broken branches and dark patches on the tree bark and floor. She slowly walked closer to a dark patch on a low green plant to her left. Winnie began to feel butterflies in her stomach. As Winnie carefully approached the dark patch, she saw the colour change to a bright red. She suddenly realised that all the dark patches she had seen were bright red.  Winnie wondered where these red patches had come from. In the corner of her eye, she noticed clumps of brown and white fur sitting on a patch of grass. There were red spots on it also. Her stomach began to flutter. Next to the patch was a bracelet with the words “best friend forever”. Winnie recognised the bracelet as it matched the one sitting on her left wrist. The bracelets were a pair and she had given one of them to her childhood friend. A short but alarming thought floated into Winnie’s mind. “Where’s Bambi?”')

These creatures move during the night, throwing hairballs filled with molten lava at buildings and people. The police, army and government are powerless against these creatures. An ancient prophecy called the Legend of Zino spoke of three children who would rise up and  save the world from the Jerocchi by using the power of special watches. However, the watches were held by a secret organisation called Crota not wanting to share the power.  On a bright sunny morning. a hooded figure stumbled through the rush hour crowd in City of Sinclair. The figure had deep emerald eyes and a long black beard. He was small in stature  but sturdy in size. He was on a mission. A mission to save the world.  Time was not on his side as he was being chased by people he used to call comrades. In a pouch hidden under his cloak, were three special watches. The figure had betrayed Crota and stolen the wacthes from them in order to find the chosen wearers. After travelling through various estates and flats,  arrived at a park behind a block of blue flats. The park was seemingly empty apart from three boys who were playing basketball on a  small court. The figure then realised that the watches were vibrating and glowing. He took this as a sign and slowly walked towards the boys. As he did so, the watches began to vibrate harder. He had finally found them. Suddenly, the figure heard the screeches of car tyres in the near distance and the sound of multiple car engines that were becoming increasingly louder.  Time was up, he had been found by Crota.')
